# AuntLydia

Made a file to automate workflow when collecting work-orders from the Lydia site.

The program collects all work orders into a dictionary and asks if the user want to send or print them out on the screen
The user can send the collected work-orders one by one as they see fit.

Username, password, e-mail for receiver and sender aswell as app-key(password) must be added manually in the var.py file.

The data-collecting process is run in headless mode on Chromebrower.
